# kb1x2
simplified version of b1x2 program (stata)
This package provides a simplified version of x1b2, if your regression do not have IVs and do not have weights, my code will do the job as the b1x2 original functionality.
The only parameter is a sequence string or number, so that the output can be saved individually.
